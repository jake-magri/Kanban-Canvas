## Description

This Kanban board app includes a secure login system using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Users log in with their credentials, and valid logins store a JWT in local storage for authenticated access. Failed logins show an error message, while inactive sessions expire automatically for security. Unauthorized access redirects users to the login page, ensuring a protected and streamlined experience.
